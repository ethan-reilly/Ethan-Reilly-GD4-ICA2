This repo was for an Individual CA for 3D Game Development in 4th Year. Given an asset pack, I was tasked with designing a level with Unity's HD Render Pipeline. 

Designing the level was interesting, and there was a lot of new things about optimization and shaders that I learned.

### What I learned
- How to use LODs(Level of Detail) for meshes to subtly change how many things the player has to render
- Using decals in HDRP to add graffiti and add to the scene
- Interior Mapping, which is a shader used to simulate floors in buildings without rendering each eoom
